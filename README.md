Low-level Javascript Library

Grokible utils are a low-level js utility library.

My intent is to have a simple, modular, no dependency js library
that can be used, without modifications to the source, both on the
front end in the browser and on the backend in node modules.

On the one hand I am developing these as an exercise to perfect my js
style, but on the other hand, I fully expect this to be a nice, usable,
fully tested, practical library when I'm done with it.

It's quite possible I'm writing something that has already been written.
The journey is the reward.

You're certainly welcome to use it, although be advised it's a WIP.

Cheers - Roger
