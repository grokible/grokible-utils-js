# grokible-utils-js

Low-level Javascript Library

Grokible utils are a low-level js utility library.  I imagine many js
authors start with some base set of their own utilities - well this is
my start of those.

The intent is to have simple, modular, no dependency js that can
be used both on the front end and on the backend in node modules
(the unit tests show how to mix the requirejs and require statements).
The initial use-case is making REST calls, which is about as fundamental
as one can get.

On the one hand I am developing these as an exercise to perfect my js
style, but on the other hand, I fully expect this to be a nice, usable,
fully tested, practical library when I'm done with it.

It's quite possible I'm writing something that has already been written.
The journey is the reward.

You're certainly welcome to use it, although be advised it's a WIP.

Cheers - Roger
